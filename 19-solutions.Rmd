In some cases there are multiple different, but equivalent answers. Let $A$ be the event the drawn card shows a "W" and $B$ be the event the drawn card shows a "X". 

1. The event $A\cap B$ is the card show "W" and "X", which cannot occur; that is, $A \cap B = \emptyset\subseteq \Omega$.

2. The event $A^c$ is the outcome the card does not show a "W".

In this case, $\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$. Let $A$ be the event $A=\{2,4\}$ and $B=\{2,4,6\}$; that is, the dice shows an even number. Then $A\subseteq B$; that is, is the event that if the dice shows 2 or 4, then the dice shows an even number.

1. $E_1 = B \setminus C$.

2. $E_2 = C \setminus B = C \cap A$.

3. $E_3 = D \setminus A = D \cap B = D \cap C$.

4. $E_4 = A \setminus (C \cup D)$.

5. $E_5 = (B \cap C) \setminus D = C \setminus (A \cup D)$.

6. $E_6 = D \setminus B = D \setminus C = A \cap D$.

The set $\displaystyle\bigcap_{k=1}^n A_k$ is the event that every roll results is a 6. This contains one sample point, namely $\omega = (6,\ldots, 6)$ and
\[
\mathbf{P} \left(
\bigcap_{k=1}^n A_k
\right)
=
\frac{1}{6^n}.
\]
:::

:::{.proof name="Solution to exercise \@ref(exr:integer)"}
The sample space is $\Omega = \{ 1, 2, \ldots, 50 \}$ and $| \Omega | = 50$. The required event is $A = \{ 12, 24, 36, 48 \}$ with $|A| = 4$. Therefore,
\[
\mathbf{P}(A) = \frac{ |A| }{|\Omega|} = \frac{4}{50} = \frac{2}{25}.

### Class 2 {-}

:::{.proof name="Solution to exercise \@ref(exr:twoevents)"}
This question is an application of Theorem\@ref(thm:propertiesofmeasures) and the principles used in its proof.

1. Observe that $A = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap B^c)$ with $A\cap B$ and $A \cap B^c$ disjoint. Therefore, using additivity,
\[
\mathbf{P}( A ) = \mathbf{P} ( (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap B^c) ) = \mathbf{P}(A\cap B) + \mathbf{P}(A \cap B^c)
\]
Hence,
\[
\mathbf{P}(A \cap B) = \mathbf{P}(A) - \mathbf{P}(A \cap B^c) = \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{10} = \frac{15}{100}.
\]

2. Observe that $B^c = (A^c \cap B^c) \cup (A \cap B^c)$ with the union being disjoint. Then using the same methods as part 1 we have
\[
\mathbf{P}(A^c \cap B^c) = \mathbf{P}(B^c) - \mathbf{P}(A \cap B^c) = 1 - \mathbf{P}(B) - \mathbf{P} (B^c \cap A) = 1 - \frac{8}{10} - \frac{1}{10} = \frac{1}{10}.
\]
:::

:::{.proof name="Solution to \@ref(exr:satprobmeasure)"}
No. Notice that for disjoint $A$ and $B$
\[
\mathbf{P}(A \cup B) = \left(
\frac{\mbox{area}(A) + \mbox{area}(B)}{\mbox{area}(\Omega)}
\right)^2 \neq \mathbf{P}(A) +  \mathbf{P}(B)
\]
:::

:::{.proof name="Solution to \@ref(exr:equallylikely)"}
Let $A$ be an event. Then $|A| = k$ for some $k \in \{ 1, 2, \ldots n \}$ and $A$ has the form $A = \{ \omega_{i_1}, \omega_{i_2}, \ldots ,\omega_{i_k}\}$, where $1 \leq i_1 < i_2 < \ldots i_k \leq n$. Then
\[
\mathbf{P}(A) = \mathbf{P} \left( \bigcup_{j=1}^k \{ \omega_{i_j} \} \right) = \sum_{j=1}^k \mathbf{P} ( \{ \omega_{i_j} \} ) = \sum_{j=1}^k \frac{1}{n} = \frac{k}{n} = \frac{| A |}{| \Omega |}.
\]
:::

:::{.proof name="Solution to \@ref(exr:twoevents2)"}
Since $A \subseteq A \cup B$ we have $1 = \mathbf{P}(A) \leq \mathbf{P} (A \cup B)$. Since $\mathbf{P} (A \cup B) \leq 1$, if follows that $\mathbf{P}(A \cup B) =1$. Furthermore,  
\[
\mathbf{P}(A \cap B) = \mathbf{P}(A) + \mathbf{P}(B) - \mathbf{P}(A \cup B) = 1 + 1 - 1 = 1.

### Class 3 {-}

:::{.proof name="Solution to exercise \@ref(exr:tablecoin)"}
Let $A_1$ be the the event that the coin crosses a horizontal side and $A_2$ the event that the coin crosses a vertical side. Then the probability that the coin will cross a side is $\mathbf{P}(B) = \mathbf{P}(A_1\cup A_2)$. The following diagram illustrates the sample space and the events $A_1$ and $A_2$.

```{r, out.width = "50%", fig.align='center', fig.cap = 'Geometry of the problem', echo=FALSE, fig.pos="H"} 
knitr::include_graphics('images/ST111_C1_Geometric_Probability_Example.png')
```

Note, you can compute $\mathbf{P}(A_1)$, $\mathbf{P}(A_2)$ and $\mathbf{P}(A_1\cap A_2)$ directly and the use $\mathbf{P}(A_1\cup A_2 ) = \mathbf{P}(A_1) + \mathbf{P}(A_2) - \mathbf{P}(A_1 \cap A_2)$. If you take this approach then $\mathbf{P}(A_1) = \dfrac{1}{5}$, $\mathbf{P}(A_2) = \dfrac{1}{10}$, $\mathbf{P}(A_1\cap A_2) = \dfrac{1}{50}$ and thus
\[
\mathbf{P}(A_1 \cup A_2) = \mathbf{P}(A_1) + \mathbf{P}(A_2) - \mathbf{P}(A_1 \cap A_2) = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{10} - \frac{1}{50} = \frac{7}{25}.

:::{.proof name="Solution to exercise \@ref(exr:newgame)"}
We may assume that the numbers in the envelops are 1, 2, 3 and 4. Thus, the sample space is $\Omega = \{ (a,b,c,d) \mid a,b,c,d \in \{1,2,3,4\}\mbox{ and } a\neq b\neq c \neq d \neq a\}$. Let $(n_1,n_2,n_3,n_4)$  be such that $\{n_1,n_2,n_3,n_4\} = \{1,2,3,4\}$ and $n_k = i$ if participant $k$ receives the $i$th participant's envelop. (For example, $(2,4,1,3)$ means participant 1 gets the 2nd participant's envelope.)

Let $A_i = \{ (n_1,n_2,n_3,n_4) : n_i = i \}$. Then $A_i$ is the event that participant $i$ receives their envelope. Let 
\[
B = \bigcup_{i = 1,2,3,4} A_i.
\]
This is the event that at least one participant receives their gives, thus we shall determine $B^c$ and then (since $\Omega$ is finite)
\[
\mathbf{P}(B^c) = \frac{|\Omega| - |B|}{|\Omega|}.
\]
Note that the events $A_1$, $A_2$, $A_3$ and $A_4$ are not disjoint, so we use the inclusion--exclusion formula; that is,
\[
|B| = \left(\sum_{i=1}^4 |A_i|\right) - \left(\sum_{1\leq i< j\leq 4} |A_i \cap A_j|\right) + \left(\sum_{1\leq i_1< i_2<i_3\leq 4} |A_{i_1} \cap A_{i_2}\cap A_{i_3}|\right) - |A_1\cap A_2 \cap A_3 \cap A_4|.
\]
We proceed in stages.

- Firstly, $|A_i| = 6$. To see this note that one $n_i$ is fixed leaving 3 terms to vary freely from a selection of three numbers. In total there are 4 sets $A_i$.
- Next, for $i\neq j$, $|A_i \cap A_j | = 2$. (Both $i$ and $j$ are fixed which leaves a choice of 2 prizes for the for 2 people, but as soon as one is selected the final one is forced.). In total there are 6 sets $A_i\cap A_j$. %So by the inclusion-exclusion formula $|A_i \cup A_j| = |A_i| + |A_j| - |A_i \cap A_j| = 6+6-2 = 10$. 
- Note that for $i\neq j\neq k\neq i$ (so $k$ is not equal to $i$ either), $|A_i \cap A_j \cap A_k| = 1$; that is, three of the components of $(n_1,n_2,n_3,n_4)$ are fixed leaving one free to be chosen from a choice of 1 number. There are four sets $A_i \cap A_j \cap A_k$.
- Finally $|A_1\cap A_2 \cap A_3 \cap A_4|=1$.
- Therefore, 
\begin{align*}
|B| &= \left(\sum_{i=1}^4 |A_i|\right) - \left(\sum_{1\leq i< j\leq 4} |A_i \cap A_j|\right) + \left(\sum_{1\leq i_1< i_2<i_3\leq 4} |A_{i_1} \cap A_{i_2}\cap A_{i_3}|\right) - |A_1\cap A_2 \cap A_3 \cap A_4| \\
&= 4\times 6 - 6\times 2 + 4\times 1 - 1 \\
&= 15
\end{align*}
Therefore,  $|B^c| = 24 - 15 = 9$.

Therefore, 
\[
\mathbf{P}(B^c) = \frac{9}{24} = \frac{3}{8}.

### Chapter 1 Consolidation {-}

:::{.proof name="Solution to exercise \@ref(exr:repeatedroll)"}
The sample space is $\Omega = \{1, 2, \ldots, 6\}^n$ and contains $6^n$ sample points.
a. Let $A$ be the event that the $n$th roll produces the first 6. Then $A = \{ (\omega_1, \ldots, \omega_{n-1}, 6) \}$, where $\omega_i \in \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \}$ for $1 \leq i \leq n-1$. Then $|A| = 5^{n-1}$ and 
\[
\mathbf{P}(A) = \frac{|A|}{|\Omega|} = \frac{5^{n-1}}{6^n} = \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^{n-1}\times\frac{1}{6}.
\] 
b. Let $A = \{ (\omega_1, \ldots, \omega_{n-1}, 6) \}$, where $\omega_i \in \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \}$ for $1 \leq i \leq n-1$ and there exists $1\leq j \leq n-1$ such that $\omega_j = 5$. Note that $|A| = |A^c|$. That is, $A$ is the event that a 5 arises before a 6, but since the die is fair, the number of ways this occurs must equal the number of ways a 6 occurs before a 5; that is, the event $A^c$. Thus since $\mathbf{P}(A) + \mathbf{P}(A^c) = 1$, $\mathbf{P}(A) = \dfrac{1}{2}$.

:::{.proof name="Solution to exercise \@ref(exr:fourplayers)"}
Let $H$ denote the outcome that the coin shows a head and $T$ denote the outcome that the coin shows a tail. 

a. Note that player 1 can only win if the first two tosses are both heads. In this case the sample space is $\Omega = \{H,T\}^2$ and contains $2^2=4$ sample points. Let $A=\{(H,H)\}$ be the event that the first two coin tosses are heads, then
\[
\mathbf{P}(A) = \frac{|E|}{|\Omega|} = \frac{1}{4}.
\]
Therefore, the probability that $P_1$ wins is $\dfrac{1}{4}$.

b. (Summary solution, you should write it out formally). If the first two coin tosses are both heads, then $P_1$ must win. If the first two tosses are both tails, then $P_3$ must win. If the first two tosses are head then tail or tail then head, then either $P_2$ or $P_4$ must win. In all cases and following the same reasoning as above, each probability is $\dfrac{1}{4}$.

:::{.proof name="Solution to exercise \@ref(exr:cardcollection)"}
The sample space $\Omega$ is all arrangements of $1, 2, \ldots, m$; that is, $\Omega = \{ (a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,\ldots, a_m) \mid \{a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,\ldots, a_m\} = \{1,2,3,4,\ldots, m\} \}$. Note $|\Omega | = m!$. Introduce the notation $n_k$, where $n_k = i$ if row position $k$ has the $i$th labelled card. Let $E_i = \{ (n_1,\ldots, n_m) \mid n_i = i \}$. Then $E_i$ is the event the card labelled $i$ is in the $i$th position in the row. We wish to determine 
\[
\mathbf{P} \left( \bigcup_{1\leq i \leq m} E_i \right).
\]
Using the inclusion-exclusion formula gives
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{P} \left( \bigcup_{1\leq i \leq n} E_i \right) &= n\times \frac{1}{n} - {n \choose 2} \times \frac{1}{n(n-1)} + {n \choose 3}\times \frac{1}{n(n-1)(n-2)} - \ldots + (-1)^{m+1}\times \frac{1}{m!} \\
&= 1 - \frac{1}{2!} + \frac{1}{3!} - \ldots + (-1)^{m+1}\frac{1}{m!}.
\end{align*}
To see this in another way. The set $E_{i_1} \cap E_{i_2} \cap \ldots \cap E_{i_k}$ is the event that the cards $i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_k$ are in the correct position. By the fundamental multiplication rule for counting, this can occur in $(m-k)!$ ways. (That is, $k$ cards must return to their original positions leaving $m-k$ cards free to be placed anyway, giving $(m-k)!$ ways.) Since there are $m$ cards we have
\[
\P (E_{i_1} \cap E_{i_2} \cap \ldots \cap E_{i_k}) = \frac{(m - k)!}{m!}.
\]
Furthermore, the summation $\displaystyle \sum_{1\leq i_1 < i_2 < \ldots < i_k \leq m} \P (E_{i_1} \cap E_{i_2} \cap \ldots \cap E_{i_k})$ contains ${m \choose k}$ terms. Therefore,
\[
\sum_{1\leq i_1 < i_2 < \ldots < i_k \leq m} \P (E_{i_1} \cap E_{i_2} \cap \ldots \cap E_{i_k}) = \frac{m!}{(m-k)!k!}\times \frac{(m-k)!}{m!} = \frac{1}{k!}.
\]
So, for example, $P_1 = \frac{1}{1!}$, $P_2 = \frac{1}{2!}$ and so on.

:::{.proof name="Solution to exercise \@ref(exr:largesquare)"}
This question is very similar to an earlier example and an appropriate diagram is almost identical. For this reason we sketch out the solutions.

a. In this case the the centre of the coin must land in a central square with side lengths $a-2r$. Hence the probability is $\dfrac{(a-2r)^2}{a^2}$.
b. In this case determine the probability of the complementary event; that is, the coin's centre comes to rest in one of the four corner squares with side $r$. Therefore, the require probability is $1 - 4\left( \dfrac{r}{a} \right)^2$.
